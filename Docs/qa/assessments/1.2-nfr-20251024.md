# NFR Assessment: Story 1.2

Date: 2025-10-24
Reviewer: Quinn

## Summary

- Security: PASS – No new telemetry fields expose sensitive query text; summaries still rely on the truncated/anonymised values verified in tests.
- Performance: CONCERNS – GPU peak usage is captured and logged, but alerting and automated enforcement remain backlog work. Treat the current logs-as-signal approach as temporary.
- Reliability: PASS – Feature toggle provenance and manifest sections have regression coverage validating enabled/disabled paths.
- Maintainability: PASS – CLI toggle parsing, telemetry scaffolding, and export summaries have unit coverage and log provenance to aid debugging.

## Outstanding Focus

- Finalise metrics-pipeline integration so rerank/sparse latency counters emit automatically during defaults-on runs (Story 1.4).
- Add an automated assertion (unit or integration) that fails when GPU soft-limit breaches occur without alerting, closing the monitoring gap (Story 1.4).

## Quick Wins

- Capture a staging run with metrics enabled and document expected telemetry blocks to accelerate dashboard wiring.
- Add a CLI help snapshot test to preserve the documented default-on wording as new flags are introduced.
