## Summary

| NFR                 | Status | Quality Impact | Notes                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ------------------- | ------ | -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Security**        | PASS   | ✅ +0          | Telemetry payloads remain truncated/anonymised; no new sensitive fields introduced.                                                                                         |
| **Performance**     | PASS   | ✅ +0          | Rerank/sparse stages emit latency and GPU peak metrics; soft-limit enforcement holds at 12 GB with alerting thresholds documented.                                          |
| **Reliability**     | PASS   | ✅ +0          | Toggle matrix smoke suite validates enabled/disabled states and records skip reasons without crashing pipeline.                                                             |
| **Maintainability** | PASS   | ✅ +0          | Runbook `docs/telemetry/rerank_sparse_signals.md` documents metrics, alerts, and operational workflows; regression tests cover telemetry summaries and Prometheus emission. |

**Overall Quality Score:** 100/100  
**Gate Recommendation:** PASS – Non-functional guardrails verified with automated smoke evidence.

## Security

- Telemetry spans and metrics continue to truncate query text to first-line previews; no raw sparse vectors are persisted when metadata fallback engages.
- No secrets or credentials introduced in new modules; all configurations sourced from environment variables or typed configs.
- Existing privacy guidance in `architecture/data-models-and-schema-changes.md` remains satisfied.

## Performance

- GPU soft-limit tracking remains enforced via `TelemetryTracker.record_gpu_snapshot`; warning (11.5 GB) and critical (12 GB) thresholds verified through `tests/test_telemetry_smoke.py::TestGpuAlertThresholds`.
- `_emit_metrics_for_stage` now emits Prometheus latency/gauge metrics with stage-aware labels; smoke tests confirm histogram/gauge payloads.
- Processing summary persists metrics status, enabling operators to audit emitter state post-run.

## Reliability

- Coverage for rerank/sparse toggles validated by `tests/test_telemetry_smoke.py::test_summary_includes_rerank_and_sparse_metrics_when_enabled` and `::test_summary_omits_rerank_and_sparse_sections_when_disabled`.
- CLI/summary alignment remains intact; regression harness scenarios continue to pass.
- Skip reasons propagate into telemetry spans and metrics reports, ensuring degraded states remain observable.

## Maintainability

- Telemetry runbook updated with metric definitions, alert rules, troubleshooting steps, and CLI toggle guidance.
- Tests cover Prometheus emitter behaviour, GPU alert thresholds, sparse fallback cases, and processing summary payloads.
- Code adheres to repository standards (88-character limit, focused inline comments, typed helpers).

## Follow-Up Suggestions

- Integrate buffered Prometheus payloads with the deployment-specific push/pull sink and add an automated regression that exercises the flush path.
- Monitor documentation freshness by linking runbook updates to deployment checklist automation.
