# Risk Profile: Story 1.2

Date: 2025-10-24
Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Executive Summary

- Total Active Risks: 2 (0 critical, 1 high, 1 medium)
- Residual Risk Score: 28/100 (automation/documentation gaps reopen Story 1.2)
- Key Watch: observability metrics are still advisory-only; GPU budget alerts remain manual log inspections until the metrics pipeline is integrated (targeted by Story 1.4).

## Critical Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

None. No score â‰¥9 risks were identified in this review cycle.

## Risk Distribution

### By Category

- Observability: 1 high (metrics emission not enforced yet)
- Performance: 1 medium (GPU soft-limit alerting still manual)
- Security: 0
- Operational: 0
- Business: 0

### By Component

- Telemetry & Metrics: 1 medium
- CLI UX & Logging: 1 low

## Detailed Risk Register

| Risk ID | Category | Description | Probability | Impact | Score | Mitigation Strategy | Residual Risk |
| ------- | -------- | ----------- | ----------- | ------ | ----- | ------------------- | ------------- |
| OBS-201 | Observability | Metrics emission for rerank/sparse stages records skip reasons but does not yet integrate with the live metrics pipeline, risking blind spots if defaults regress. | High | High | 9 | Wire the telemetry emitter into staging dashboards, automate Prometheus alerting, and block release until smoke coverage enforces emission (Story 1.4). | Low once metrics hook and alerts ship. |
| PERF-202 | Performance | GPU soft-limit exceedance is surfaced in logs and summaries, but no automated alert fires when VRAM crosses the warning threshold. | Medium | Medium | 6 | Add regression coverage plus automated alerting so peak VRAM breaches raise incidents without manual log review (Story 1.4). | Low after alerting is deployed; monitor manually meanwhile. |

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

- Add an integration test that forces metrics emission on and asserts the telemetry block reports `emitted` for rerank/sparse; covers OBS-201.
- Extend the processing-summary regression suite with a scenario that simulates VRAM over-limit data to keep PERF-202 visible until automated alerting lands.

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

- No open risk exceeds score 6, so defaults-on rollout can proceed with monitoring commitments.
- Escalate the gate if OBS-201 is still unresolved when telemetry work begins in Story 1.3.

## Monitoring Requirements

- Sample processing summaries from nightly runs to confirm `metrics` blocks show `emitted` once the metrics hook is live.
- Watch for GPU soft-limit warnings (>11.5 GB) in CI logs; raise an incident if two consecutive runs exceed the warning threshold.

## Risk Review Triggers

- Any change to telemetry emission plumbing or metrics namespace configuration.
- Introduction of new GPU-intensive models or batch size adjustments in the CLI defaults.
