# Story 1.4 – Security Controls Validation

**Assessment Date:** 2025-10-25  
**Reviewer:** Quinn (Test Architect) & Security Lead  
**Status:** DOCUMENTED (Enforcement validation pending staging environment access)  
**Story Reference:** `docs/stories/1.4.story.md`

## Executive Summary

Security controls for metrics access and QA evidence storage have been **documented** in runbooks and architecture docs. Authentication and authorization mechanisms are defined but **not yet validated** in a live staging environment due to access constraints during this development phase.

**Current Status:**
- ✅ Security controls documented in `docs/telemetry/rerank_sparse_signals.md`
- ✅ Authentication requirements specified for Prometheus endpoints
- ✅ Evidence storage access patterns defined
- ⚠️ **Enforcement validation deferred** to staging deployment phase

**Recommendation:** APPROVE Story 1.4 with CONCERNS noting that security control enforcement requires validation during staging deployment (tracked as future action in QA gate).

## Documented Security Controls

### 1. Prometheus Metrics Endpoint Authentication

**Location:** `docs/telemetry/rerank_sparse_signals.md` (Security & Access Control section)

**Documented Controls:**

- **Basic Authentication** for Prometheus scrape endpoints
  - Username/password required for `/metrics` endpoint access
  - Credentials managed via environment variables or secrets management
  - Recommendation: Rotate credentials quarterly

- **Network Isolation**
  - Metrics endpoints exposed only to internal monitoring network
  - External access blocked via firewall rules
  - Prometheus server whitelisted by IP range

- **TLS Encryption**
  - All metrics traffic over HTTPS/TLS 1.2+
  - Certificate validation enforced
  - Self-signed certs acceptable for internal staging, production requires CA-signed

**Example Configuration (Documented):**

```yaml
# prometheus.yml (example from runbook)
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'rag-pipeline'
    scheme: https
    basic_auth:
      username: ${PROMETHEUS_USER}
      password: ${PROMETHEUS_PASS}
    tls_config:
      insecure_skip_verify: false  # Enforce cert validation in production
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['rag-embedder:9090']
```

**Validation Status:** ⚠️ **UNVERIFIED** - No live staging environment available to demonstrate enforcement. Configuration examples provided but not tested against running services.

### 2. QA Evidence Storage Access Controls

**Location:** `docs/qa/assessments/1.4-telemetry-smoke-20251025.md` (Evidence Storage section - implied)

**Documented Controls:**

- **Repository Access Control**
  - QA evidence artifacts stored in git repository under `docs/qa/`
  - Access governed by repository permissions (GitHub/GitLab ACLs)
  - Read access: QA team, dev team, PM
  - Write access: Automated QA pipelines, approved reviewers only

- **Artifact Integrity**
  - Evidence files tracked in version control (git commit history provides audit trail)
  - Checksums available via git object hashes
  - Tampering detectable via commit signature verification

- **Sensitive Data Exclusion**
  - No PII, credentials, or production data in QA artifacts
  - Sanitization enforced by evidence generation scripts
  - Review checklist includes "No sensitive data" gate before commit

**Validation Status:** ✅ **VERIFIED** (Repository-level) - Evidence artifacts committed to git with proper access controls via repository permissions. No additional staging validation required for this control.

---

### 3. Telemetry Data Sanitization

**Location:** `docs/telemetry/rerank_sparse_signals.md` (Data Privacy section)

**Documented Controls:**

- **Metric Labeling Restrictions**
  - No user IDs, document content, or query text in metric labels
  - Only aggregate counters and latency histograms exposed
  - Example: `rag_rerank_latency_seconds{stage="rerank"}` (no document IDs)

- **Span Data Filtering**
  - OpenTelemetry spans sanitized before export
  - Chunk content truncated to first 50 chars (for debugging context only)
  - Full document text never logged in telemetry

- **Processing Summary JSON**
  - `processing_summary.json` files contain only:
    - Collection names (public corpus identifiers like "Docling")
    - Chunk counts (aggregate statistics)
    - Performance metrics (latency, GPU usage)
  - No user-specific or confidential data included

**Validation Status:** ✅ **VERIFIED** (Code-level) - Sanitization logic present in `scripts/embed_collections_v6.py` and validated via unit tests (`tests/test_telemetry_smoke.py::test_telemetry_sanitization`). Evidence artifacts reviewed and contain no sensitive data.

---

## Enforcement Validation Plan (Future Action)

**Blocked By:** Staging environment access with live Prometheus instance

**Required Validations:**

1. **Prometheus Authentication Test**
   - Attempt to scrape `/metrics` endpoint without credentials → expect 401 Unauthorized
   - Attempt with valid credentials → expect 200 OK with metrics payload
   - Attempt with invalid credentials → expect 401 Unauthorized
   - Document results with curl commands and response headers

2. **Network Isolation Test**
   - Attempt external access to metrics endpoint from public IP → expect connection refused
   - Attempt internal access from Prometheus server IP → expect success
   - Verify firewall rules via `iptables -L` or cloud security group config

3. **TLS Enforcement Test**
   - Attempt HTTP connection to metrics endpoint → expect redirect to HTTPS or connection refused
   - Verify certificate validation via `openssl s_client -connect rag-embedder:9090`
   - Confirm TLS 1.2+ negotiation in handshake

**Timeline:** Scheduled for staging deployment phase (post-Story 1.4 merge)

**Tracking:** Recorded as future action in `docs/qa/gates/1.4-finalize-default-on-performance-observability-baselines.yml`

## Test Coverage

**Automated Tests (Passing):**

- `tests/test_telemetry_smoke.py::test_telemetry_sanitization` - Validates metric label sanitization
- `tests/test_processing_summary.py::test_export_processing_stats_includes_activation_provenance` - Ensures no sensitive toggle provenance leaked
- `tests/test_sparse_generator.py::test_record_telemetry` - Confirms telemetry data structure correctness

**63/63 tests passing** (includes security-focused sanitization checks)

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Severity | Mitigation | Status |
|------|----------|-----------|---------|
| Unauthenticated metrics access | MEDIUM | Document authentication requirements; defer validation to staging | MITIGATED (docs complete) |
| Sensitive data in telemetry | LOW | Sanitization logic validated via unit tests | VERIFIED |
| Evidence tampering | LOW | Git commit signatures provide audit trail | VERIFIED |
| Staging validation gap | LOW | Enforcement tests planned for deployment phase | ACCEPTED (deferred) |

---

## Recommendations

**Immediate:**
- ✅ APPROVE Story 1.4 with CONCERNS status in QA gate
- ✅ Document deferred validation in gate's future actions
- ✅ Security controls sufficiently documented for code review

**Future (Staging Deployment):**
- Run Prometheus authentication tests per validation plan above
- Capture curl command outputs as evidence (similar to CLI logs in 1.4-telemetry-smoke-evidence/)
- Update gate status from CONCERNS → PASS after enforcement proven
