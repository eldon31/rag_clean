# Story 4.1 Ensemble Flow Validation — 2025-10-30

## Evidence Summary

- Authored `docs/architecture/ensemble-flow.md` mapping CLI → embedder →
  leasing → adaptive batching → sparse → rerank → export → telemetry.
- Cross-referenced `batch_runner.py`, `gpu_lease.py`, `model_manager.py`,
  `cross_encoder_executor.py`, `sparse_generator.py`, `summary.py`, and
  telemetry helpers as required by AC2.
- Linked the new document from `docs/architecture/index.md`, the Story 4.1 PRD,
  and `docs/telemetry/rerank_sparse_signals.md` to satisfy surfacing
  expectations.

## Test Runs

- 2025-10-30 08:06 UTC — `python -m pytest tests/test_processing_summary.py -k
rerank` → ✅
- 2025-10-30 08:16 UTC — `python -m pytest
tests/test_telemetry_smoke.py::TestTelemetrySpansWithMetrics::test_rerank_span_active_includes_metrics_status`
  → ✅

Warnings: Deprecation warning from `importlib.metadata` Python 3.12 (known, no
impact).

## Notes

- Evidence stored alongside this report; no sensitive identifiers captured.
- Tests confirm manifest rerank payloads and telemetry span coverage referenced
  by the new documentation.
