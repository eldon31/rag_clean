| R1  | Reliability     | Telemetry smoke matrix evidence might regress between releases.                            | Low (1)     | Medium (2) | 2     | Mitigated          | `docs/qa/assessments/1.4-telemetry-smoke-20251025.md` plus `docs/qa/assessments/1.4-telemetry-smoke-evidence/` now store 5 CLI logs and 5 processing summaries covering every toggle combination; continue regenerating after major changes. |
| R2  | Governance      | Upstream QA gates (1.1–1.3) must stay aligned with Story 1.4 evidence.                     | Low (1)     | Medium (2) | 2     | Closed             | Gate files updated to PASS with explicit artifact references (`docs/qa/gates/1.1-*.yml`–`1.3-*.yml`); audit trail restored.                                                                                                                  |
| R3  | Security        | Prometheus endpoint authentication and network isolation still require staging validation. | Medium (2)  | Medium (2) | 4     | Open               | Controls documented and mock HTTPS validation executed, but validator currently uses `--no-verify-tls`; capture staging evidence with verification enabled to close SEC-118.                                                                 |
| R4  | Maintainability | CLI enable-synonym handling could drift without regression coverage.                       | Low (1)     | Low (1)    | 1     | Closed             | `tests/test_embed_collections_cli.py` now asserts enable/disable precedence and telemetry provenance logging matches docs.                                                                                                                   |
| R5  | Process         | Checklist accuracy relies on evidence staying in sync with `[x]` markers.                  | Low (1)     | Low (1)    | 1     | Accepted (Monitor) | Story artifacts delivered; keep spot-auditing automated checklist edits to ensure evidence accompanies bulk updates.                                                                                                                         |
| R6  | Performance     | GPU latency and VRAM baselines rely on CPU fallback data.                                  | Medium (2)  | Low (1)    | 2     | Open               | `docs/qa/assessments/1.4-baselines-20251025.md` records planning targets only; execute staging GPU run and archive metrics to finalize performance posture.                                                                                  |

## Mitigation Recommendations

1. Validate Prometheus authentication, network isolation, and TLS enforcement in staging per `docs/qa/assessments/1.4-security-controls-20251025.md`; capture curl outputs as evidence.
2. Capture GPU latency/VRAM baselines on staging hardware and update `docs/qa/assessments/1.4-baselines-20251025.md` with measured values.
3. Automate regeneration of telemetry smoke artifacts (CLI output + `processing_summary.json`) in CI to keep evidence fresh across releases.
4. Continue checklist spot-audits so future bulk `[x]` updates remain backed by committed artifacts and logs.
