# NFR Assessment: 1.4

Date: 2025-10-25  
Reviewer: Quinn

## Summary

- Security: CONCERNS – Authentication controls documented and mock HTTPS validation exercises credential enforcement, but TLS verification still runs with `--no-verify-tls`; staging evidence with verification enabled remains outstanding (see `docs/qa/assessments/1.4-security-controls-20251025.md`).
- Performance: CONCERNS – Current telemetry relies on CPU fallback evidence; GPU latency/VRAM baselines in `docs/qa/assessments/1.4-baselines-20251025.md` are targets awaiting staging capture.
- Reliability: PASS – Telemetry smoke artifacts (`docs/qa/assessments/1.4-telemetry-smoke-20251025.md` + evidence folder) provide verifiable coverage across all rerank/sparse combinations.
- Maintainability: PASS – Documentation, CLI help text, and regression suites align (see `docs/telemetry/rerank_sparse_signals.md` and `tests/test_embed_collections_cli.py`).

## Critical Issues

Outstanding staging validations keep Security and Performance at CONCERNS until HTTPS evidence and GPU baselines are captured.

## Optional Enhancements

- Execute the staged Prometheus authentication validation plan once access is available; attach curl/TLS transcripts alongside `1.4-security-controls`.
- Automate telemetry smoke matrix regeneration in CI (invoke CLI with four toggle combinations and archive outputs) to guard against drift.
- Add a doc-sync lint that verifies evidence paths referenced in Story 1.4 assessments exist before merging future updates.
