# Story 1.2 NFR Assessment â€” 2025-10-31

## Summary

- Performance: Telemetry captures GPU soft-limit status and latency metrics; targeted pytest suite remains green. No regressions observed.
- Reliability: Toggle resolution chain logged and processing summaries emit provenance; regression harness exercises enable/disable matrices.
- Usability: Help epilog now derives sparse defaults from runtime configuration and the new unit test guards against future drift, restoring operator trust.
- Security/Privacy: Rerank query string remains synthetic and truncated; no new data exposure noted.

## Notable Observations

- CLI help string is dynamically composed using `load_feature_toggles`; when defaults change, messaging stays synchronized automatically.
- `test_help_mentions_sparse_default` captures the current default (`splade`), providing an early warning if documentation diverges.

## Recommendations

1. Keep the help snapshot test updated whenever sparse model defaults legitimately change.
2. Continue monitoring telemetry dashboards to ensure operators see consistent toggle provenance.

## Verdict

- Security: PASS
- Performance: PASS
- Reliability: PASS
- Maintainability: PASS
- Usability: PASS
