# NFR Assessment: 1.1

Date: 2025-10-23
Reviewer: Quinn

## Summary

- Security: PASS – Default-on toggles reuse existing override channels; no new secret flows introduced.
- Performance: CONCERNS – Additional model hydration occurs by default without load/latency measurements to confirm the T4 budget. Capture baseline sampling before enabling defaults on large corpora.
- Reliability: PASS – Processing summary now resolves chunk totals from loader telemetry with regression coverage locking the behaviour.
- Maintainability: PASS – CLI toggle parsing has direct unit coverage for default-on, opt-out, and provenance reporting paths.

## Outstanding Focus

- **Performance telemetry** – Record cold-start and steady-state timings for the default-on flow so future regressions surface quickly (tracked via Story 1.4 with documentation/QA evidence requirements).

## Quick Wins

- Automate periodic latency sampling for the exclusive ensemble path and retain comparison checkpoints.
- Keep toggle provenance assertions in CLI tests up to date when new feature flags or defaults are introduced.
- Extend documentation with a short checklist for capturing performance baselines during staging rollouts.
