# NFR Assessment: 2.1

Date: 2025-10-25
Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Summary

- Security: PASS – Telemetry sanitization is now enforced by targeted regression tests covering sensitive inputs.
- Performance: PASS – 12 GB VRAM guardrails with adaptive batching are implemented and validated via unit tests.
- Reliability: PASS – Comprehensive unit and integration coverage confirm graceful fallback and telemetry capture.
- Maintainability: PASS – End-to-end persistence tests protect the `SparseInferenceRun` schema and documentation remains current.

## Findings

### Security – PASS

- Evidence: `tests/test_sparse_generator.py::TestSparseVectorGenerator::test_telemetry_sanitization` injects sensitive substrings and verifies sparse telemetry omits them, demonstrating enforced redaction.
- Controls: `SparseVectorGenerator._record_telemetry` continues to emit only aggregate metrics, reducing residual privacy exposure.
- Residual Risk: Low – Future schema changes should retain the sanitization test to prevent regressions.

### Performance – PASS

- Evidence: `_enforce_vram_cap` guards both soft (10 GB) and hard (12 GB) thresholds and records telemetry when limits are approached (`tests/test_sparse_generator.py::test_vram_hard_cap_violation`).
- Validation: `test_gpu_inference_with_vram_enforcement` exercises GPU execution with VRAM monitoring, ensuring telemetry captures peak usage and staging resets models post-run.
- Residual Risk: Moderate – Large corpora may still benefit from stress runs; keep adaptive heuristics under observation in staging.

### Reliability – PASS

- Evidence: Unit coverage spans absence of models, encoding failures, lease errors, and telemetry reporting; integration suite (`tests/test_processing_summary.py`) exercises processing summaries and telemetry exports.
- Observability: Telemetry metrics and span presence cover both success and failure paths, bolstering operational insight.
- Residual Risk: Low – Continue periodic chaos testing on lease pools to catch concurrency regressions.

### Maintainability – PASS

- Evidence: `tests/test_processing_summary.py::test_sparse_generator_end_to_end_persistence` proves that live generator outputs persist into `processing_summary.json`, closing the prior schema gap.
- Documentation: Story and architecture references remain aligned with the module layout in `processor/ultimate_embedder/sparse_generator.py`.
- Residual Risk: Low – Encourage periodic review as new schema fields are added.

## Monitoring & Follow-up

- Track telemetry dashboards for VRAM soft-limit alerts to fine-tune adaptive batching thresholds.
- Keep sanitization regression in required CI gates to prevent future leakage of sensitive text.
- Schedule quarterly review of sparse persistence artifacts to ensure schema additions remain backward compatible.
