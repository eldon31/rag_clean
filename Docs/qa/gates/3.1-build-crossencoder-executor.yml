# Quality Gate Decision for Story 3.1

schema: 1
story: "3.1"
story_title: "Build CrossEncoder Executor"
gate: PASS
status_reason: "Reranking-disabled fallback now clamps results to top_k with regression coverage verifying the contract."

    title: "No open risks"
  recommendations:
    monitor:
      - "Continue tracking GPU telemetry to tune batch-size heuristics as production data accrues"

      Output: reranking-disabled fallback returned 2 candidates (top_k contract honored)

nfr_validation:
  _assessed: [security, performance, reliability, maintainability]
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Query truncation enforced; leasing telemetry recorded for audit trail."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Dynamic batching active; telemetry available for future calibration."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Fallback path clamps to top_k and regression test guards the contract."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Extensive unit/integration coverage captures regression scenarios."

recommendations:
  immediate: []
  future:
    - action: "Invoke torch.cuda.reset_peak_memory_stats before capturing peak usage to tighten telemetry accuracy"
