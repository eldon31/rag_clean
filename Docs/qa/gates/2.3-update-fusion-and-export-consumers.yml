# Non-Functional Requirements Assessment
nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "No security concerns. Sparse tokens sanitized, telemetry sanitization prevents query string leakage, no authentication/authorization changes."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Optimal performance characteristics. Additive schema has minimal overhead, efficient streaming JSONL writes, O(1) schema version determination, test suite runs in 6.22s."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Excellent error handling throughout. Graceful degradation for missing sparse files, defensive .get() usage, conditional exports prevent failures when sparse disabled."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Exceptional maintainability. Clear separation of concerns, comprehensive inline documentation (summary.py lines 203-228), type hints throughout, follows coding standards (88-char limit, succinct comments)."

# Final Assessment
final_assessment: |
  Story 2.3 represents exemplary engineering with exceptional attention to backward compatibility,
  test coverage, and code quality. The implementation was completed entirely through verification
  of existing code from Story 2.2, with 5 new integration tests added to validate legacy
  compatibility and graceful degradation scenarios.
  
  Key achievements:
  - 100% backward compatible additive schema design
  - 14/14 tests passing with zero warnings
  - Comprehensive inline documentation
  - Zero security, performance, or reliability concerns
  - Production-ready code requiring no refactoring
  
  This story exemplifies best practices for incremental feature delivery in complex systems.
  Recommended for immediate production deployment.
