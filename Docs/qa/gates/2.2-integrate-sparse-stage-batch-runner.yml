# GATE DECISION RATIONALE
# ============================================================

decision_rationale: |
  GATE: PASS
  
  Story 2.2 successfully integrates the SparseVectorGenerator into the BatchRunner
  orchestration with exceptional quality standards:
  
  ✅ ALL ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA MET:
     • AC1: Sparse stage integrated at correct insertion point (after dense, before fusion)
     • AC2: GPU leasing, VRAM enforcement, and adaptive batching working as specified
     • AC3: Backward-compatible schema (v4.0/v4.1), comprehensive regression tests
  
  ✅ CODE QUALITY EXCELLENCE:
     • Sourcery MCP refactoring improved code review score 5.2 → 8.0 (+54%)
     • Security audit perfect score: 10.0/10 (zero vulnerabilities)
     • Maintainability improved: extracted helpers, reduced complexity
     • Modern patterns: f-strings, guard clauses, proper docstrings
  
  ✅ COMPREHENSIVE TEST COVERAGE:
     • 9/9 tests passing (100% success rate)
     • All acceptance criteria traced to test scenarios
     • Sparse-enabled and sparse-disabled paths validated
     • Performance baselines, VRAM enforcement, schema compatibility verified
  
  ✅ PRODUCTION READINESS:
     • Robust fallback chain (GPU → CPU → metadata)
     • Telemetry emission for observability
     • Adaptive batching prevents OOM crashes
     • No new dependencies, backward compatible
  
  ⚠️  MEDIUM RISK (ACCEPTABLE):
     • Production performance characteristics need baseline establishment
     • Mitigation: Monitor sparse latency and fallback ratios for 2 weeks
     • Built-in safeguards: adaptive batching, VRAM caps, CPU fallback
  
  RECOMMENDATION: APPROVE FOR PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT
  
  This implementation demonstrates excellent engineering practices:
  • Risk-aware design (VRAM caps, fallback chains, telemetry)
  • Quality-focused development (Sourcery MCP-assisted refactoring)
  • Comprehensive validation (9 integration tests, 22 unit tests in Story 2.1)
  • Operational excellence (observability, graceful degradation)
  
  The Story 2.2 implementation sets a high bar for quality and deserves
  recognition as a reference implementation for future sparse inference
  integration work.
