## Purpose and Scope

This document explains the implementation of a reverse image search system for e-commerce applications using Qdrant vector database. The system enables users to find visually similar products by uploading an image instead of typing text queries. This implementation focuses on:

- Processing product images into vector embeddings
- Storing these embeddings with product metadata in Qdrant
- Performing efficient similarity searches based on user-uploaded images
- Filtering results based on product attributes such as price and category

For general information about image data applications in Qdrant, see [Image Data Applications](qdrant/examples/4-image-data-applications.md). For medical imaging applications, see [Medical Image Search with ViT](qdrant/examples/4.2-medical-image-search-with-vision-transformers.md).

## System Overview

The e-commerce reverse image search system implements a complete pipeline for both indexing product images and handling search queries.

```

## Data Flow and Processing

### Product Data Ingestion

The system begins by processing a catalog of product images and their metadata:

```
```

The ingestion process involves:

1. **Data Loading**: Product images and metadata are loaded from a structured dataset
2. **Image Processing**: Images are resized, cropped, and normalized to meet the input requirements of the vision model
3. **Embedding Generation**: A pre-trained vision model converts images into high-dimensional vector embeddings
4. **Metadata Preparation**: Product information is structured for efficient storage and retrieval
5. **Data Storage**: Both embeddings and metadata are stored in a Qdrant collection

Sources:

### Search Process

When a user submits a query image, the system processes it as follows:

```
```

The search workflow consists of:

1. **Query Processing**: The query image undergoes the same preprocessing and embedding generation as catalog images
2. **Filter Construction**: User-specified filters (e.g., category, price range) are converted into Qdrant filter conditions
3. **Similarity Search**: Qdrant finds vectors similar to the query embedding, optionally filtered by metadata
4. **Result Processing**: Search results are formatted and returned to the user

Sources:

## Technical Implementation

### Vision Model

The implementation uses a pre-trained vision model to generate embeddings from product images. Common options include:

- ResNet models (ResNet-50, ResNet-101)
- Vision Transformer (ViT)
- CLIP (for multi-modal capabilities)

These models produce fixed-size vector embeddings (typically 512-2048 dimensions) that capture visual features of products.

### Qdrant Collection Structure

The Qdrant collection for e-commerce products is configured with:

```
```

### Product Metadata Schema

Each product record in Qdrant includes:

| Field          | Type   | Description                       |
| -------------- | ------ | --------------------------------- |
| `product_id`   | string | Unique identifier for the product |
| `name`         | string | Product name                      |
| `description`  | string | Product description               |
| `price`        | float  | Product price                     |
| `currency`     | string | Currency code (e.g., USD, EUR)    |
| `category`     | string | Product category                  |
| `subcategory`  | string | Product subcategory               |
| `brand`        | string | Product brand or manufacturer     |
| `image_url`    | string | URL to the product image          |
| `availability` | string | Product availability status       |

### Vector Search with Filtering

A key feature of the e-commerce implementation is the ability to combine vector similarity search with metadata filters:

```
```

This allows for queries like "find visually similar clothing items between $20 and $100."

## Example Implementation Workflow

### Indexing Product Data

The general workflow for product data indexing involves:

1. **Dataset Preparation**: Organizing product images and metadata
2. **Collection Initialization**: Creating a Qdrant collection with appropriate vector configuration
3. **Batch Processing**: Generating embeddings for all product images
4. **Batch Upload**: Storing embeddings and metadata in Qdrant

Example pseudo-implementation:

```
```

### Processing Search Queries

The search workflow handles user queries as follows:

1. **Image Upload**: User submits a query image
2. **Preprocessing**: Image is preprocessed as done during indexing
3. **Embedding Generation**: Vision model generates an embedding for the query image
4. **Filter Application**: Optional user filters are applied
5. **Vector Search**: Similar products are retrieved from Qdrant
6. **Result Presentation**: Results are returned to the user

Example pseudo-implementation:

```
```

Sources:

## Use Cases and Applications

The e-commerce reverse image search system enables several valuable scenarios:

1. **Visual Product Discovery**: Users can find products by uploading images instead of typing keywords
2. **"Shop the Look"**: Users can upload lifestyle images to find specific items or similar styles
3. **Product Recommendations**: Visually similar products can be suggested based on what a user is viewing
4. **Inventory Management**: Visually similar products can be identified for catalog organization
5. **Competitive Analysis**: Products similar to competitors' offerings can be found

## System Performance Considerations

### Vector Indexing

For large e-commerce catalogs, vector indexing is crucial for performance:

```
```

Qdrant's HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World) index provides efficient approximate nearest neighbor search, which is essential for real-time performance with large product catalogs.

### Filtering Optimization

Pre-filtering with Qdrant improves performance by reducing the candidate set before vector comparison:

```
```

## Conclusion

The E-commerce Reverse Image Search example demonstrates how Qdrant can be used to implement a powerful visual search system for retail applications. By combining efficient vector search with metadata filtering, the system enables intuitive product discovery based on visual similarity.

This implementation can serve as a starting point for building production-ready visual search features in e-commerce platforms, with potential for enhancements such as multi-modal embeddings, attribute extraction, and personalization.
