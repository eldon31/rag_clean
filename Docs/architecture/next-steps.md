# Next Steps

1. Implement CrossEncoder and sparse executor modules, integrate with `BatchRunner`, and wire CLI flags.
2. Update export runtime and telemetry instrumentation, including schema versioning and docs.
3. Add regression tests and performance benchmarks ensuring rerank/sparse paths stay within resource limits.
4. Roll out in staged environment (e.g., local GPU, then Kaggle) with telemetry monitoring before broad adoption.
