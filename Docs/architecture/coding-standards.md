# Coding Standards

- Follow existing 88-character line limit, Ruff linting, and type hints (Pydantic models typed explicitly).
- Document new modules with high-level docstrings summarizing orchestration responsibilities.
- Add succinct inline comments only where orchestration or leasing logic would otherwise be opaque (per repo coding standards).
