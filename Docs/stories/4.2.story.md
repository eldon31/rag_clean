# Story 4.2: Export Schema Versioning and Validation

## Status

Done

## Story

**As a** export maintainer,
**I want** manifest and JSONL schemas versioned to include rerank/sparse payloads,
**so that** downstream tools parse enriched data safely.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Manifest bumped to v4.1 with optional rerank/sparse sections and documented schema changes.
2. Validation scripts/tests confirm legacy (v4.0) and new (v4.1) artifacts both parse.
3. Tooling emits warnings when rerank/sparse expected but absent, without breaking runs.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Update export runtime writers in `processor/ultimate_embedder/export_runtime.py`, manifest helpers in `processor/ultimate_embedder/summary.py`, and JSONL serializers in `processor/ultimate_embedder/export.py` to emit manifest version v4.1 with optional `rerank_run` and `sparse_run` sections populated when stages execute, leaving legacy fields untouched (AC: 1) [Source: architecture/data-models-and-schema-changes.md#schema-integration-strategy]
  - [x] Ensure `CrossEncoderRerankRun` and `SparseInferenceRun` payloads serialize into the manifest with additive fields only across those modules (AC: 1) [Source: architecture/data-models-and-schema-changes.md#crossencoderrerankrun]
  - [x] Preserve JSONL writers so rerank scores and sparse vectors append without altering existing keys or order in `processor/ultimate_embedder/export.py` (AC: 1) [Source: architecture/component-architecture.md#updated-components]
- [x] Document schema bump and optional sections in `docs/architecture/data-models-and-schema-changes.md`, `docs/architecture/infrastructure-and-deployment.md`, and `docs/prd/epic-4-export-schema-regression-hardening-and-ensemble-documentation.md` so operators understand the additive guidance (AC: 1) [Source: docs/prd/epic-4-export-schema-regression-hardening-and-ensemble-documentation.md#story-4-2-export-schema-versioning-and-validation]
  - [x] Align documentation updates with `ExportRuntime` responsibilities and reference the ensemble flow overview in `docs/architecture/ensemble-flow.md` for cross-links (AC: 1) [Source: architecture/component-architecture.md#updated-components]
- [x] Extend regression suites `tests/test_processing_summary.py` and `tests/test_telemetry_smoke.py` to parse and verify both v4.0 and v4.1 manifests/JSONL outputs, covering success and fallback warning scenarios (AC: 2) [Source: architecture/testing-and-validation.md#integration-tests]
  - [x] Add fixtures or sample payload builders inside those test modules to exercise rerank/sparse enabled and disabled runs, asserting compatibility paths and schema warnings (AC: 2) [Source: architecture/testing-and-validation.md#integration-tests]
- [x] Emit runtime warnings when rerank or sparse toggles are enabled but payloads are missing by updating `processor/ultimate_embedder/summary.py`, `scripts/embed_collections_v6.py`, and related telemetry notes, keeping exports non-blocking (AC: 3) [Source: architecture/operational-safeguards.md#brownfield-rollback-and-contingency-plan]
  - [x] Surface warnings in CLI summaries and processing summaries, and add regression checks in `tests/test_processing_summary.py` to assert the warning text (AC: 3) [Source: architecture/component-architecture.md#updated-components]

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

- Story 4.1 confirmed the canonical ensemble flow and cross-links to orchestration modules; reuse those references so schema documentation aligns with the documented execution order. [Source: docs/stories/4.1.story.md#dev-notes]

### Export Manifest Requirements

- Export runtime writes `processing_summary.json` as v4.1, sequencing dense, sparse, and rerank artifacts so consumers see data together after all stages complete. [Source: architecture/infrastructure-and-deployment.md#runtime-outputs-and-storage-order]
- Manifest versioning remains additive with optional `rerank_run` and `sparse_run` sections to keep legacy tooling compatible. [Source: architecture/data-models-and-schema-changes.md#schema-integration-strategy]

### Data Models

- `CrossEncoderRerankRun` includes identifiers, candidate lists, scores, latency, and GPU peaks that must serialize when rerank executes. [Source: architecture/data-models-and-schema-changes.md#crossencoderrerankrun]
- `SparseInferenceRun` tracks sparse model identifiers, vectors, latency, and fallback flags; exports must persist these fields when sparse inference runs. [Source: architecture/data-models-and-schema-changes.md#sparseinferencerun]

### JSONL and Artifact Expectations

- `ExportRuntime` appends rerank scores and sparse content to JSONL outputs while retaining previous keys, ensuring additive schema changes. [Source: architecture/component-architecture.md#updated-components]
- CLI orchestration ensures artifacts land after dense fusion, sparse generation, rerank, and export stages run in order, so schema updates must align with this pipeline. [Source: architecture/component-architecture.md#component-interaction-diagram]

### Observability and Warnings

- CLI summaries report rerank model, batch size, latency, GPU usage, and sparse activation, providing the surface to expose missing payload warnings without failing runs. [Source: architecture/component-architecture.md#updated-components]
- Processing summaries capture span status and fallback reasons, enabling non-blocking alerts when stages skip or payloads are absent. [Source: architecture/observability.md#opentelemetry-spans]

### File Locations

- Export writers and related orchestration live under `processor/ultimate_embedder/` alongside batch runner and telemetry modules used for schema serialization. [Source: architecture/source-tree.md#existing-project-structure-relevant-extract]
- CLI entry `scripts/embed_collections_v6.py` surfaces runtime warnings and summary logs for schema validation feedback. [Source: architecture/source-tree.md#existing-project-structure-relevant-extract]

### Technical Constraints

- Schema updates must remain additive and honor backward compatibility so dense-only runs with toggles disabled omit new sections gracefully. [Source: architecture/enhancement-scope-and-integration-strategy.md#compatibility-requirements]
- Runtime toggles `EMBEDDER_ENABLE_RERANK` and `EMBEDDER_ENABLE_SPARSE` need to stay authoritative for rollback scenarios; warnings should guide operators without breaking flows. [Source: architecture/operational-safeguards.md#brownfield-rollback-and-contingency-plan]
- Manifest payloads must keep query and telemetry fields truncated or anonymized per data model definitions to maintain privacy expectations. [Source: architecture/data-models-and-schema-changes.md#crossencoderrerankrun]

### Project Structure Notes

- Schema versioning changes should remain within existing export modules and documentation paths inside `docs/architecture/` to comply with defined structure. [Source: architecture/source-tree.md#existing-project-structure-relevant-extract]

### Testing

- Run `poetry run pytest tests/test_processing_summary.py -k "v4_1_schema"` to validate additive manifest sections and legacy parser behaviour for v4.0 artifacts. [Source: architecture/testing-and-validation.md#integration-tests]
- Run `poetry run pytest tests/test_telemetry_smoke.py::TestTelemetrySpansWithMetrics::test_disabled_stage_skips_metrics_emission` to confirm warning and skip metadata remain intact when stages fail to produce payloads. [Source: architecture/testing-and-validation.md#integration-tests]
- Execute an end-to-end embedder smoke run `poetry run python scripts/embed_collections_v6.py --collections demo --limit 25 --output-dir ./artifacts/demo-v4-1` to capture a v4.1 `processing_summary.json` and verify new sections plus warning copy when toggles are enabled. [Source: architecture/infrastructure-and-deployment.md#kaggle-notebook-workflow]
- Maintain existing unit coverage of serialization helpers with `poetry run pytest tests/test_runtime_config.py tests/test_embed_collections_cli.py` ensuring toggle precedence and CLI surfaces stay aligned with schema updates. [Source: architecture/testing-and-validation.md#unit-tests]
- Track performance regressions by re-running `poetry run pytest tests/test_processing_summary.py -k "latency"` or the broader suite once schema updates land, keeping latency/GPU caps within baselines. [Source: architecture/testing-and-validation.md#performance-tests]
