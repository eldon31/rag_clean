# Story 1.1: Default-On Configuration Wiring

## Status

Ready for Done

## Story

**As a** deployment operator,
**I want** rerank and sparse stages enabled automatically through configuration defaults,
**so that** every execution benefits from the enhanced retrieval stack without manual flag work.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Configuration loaders default to enabling rerank and sparse stages while honoring override switches (env vars, config files).
2. Unit tests cover default-on behavior and explicit opt-out paths.
3. Documentation highlights default settings and how to disable stages.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Update configuration loaders so rerank and sparse defaults initialize as enabled while preserving override semantics via env vars and config files (AC: 1) [Source: architecture/enhancement-scope-and-integration-strategy.md#compatibility-requirements]
  - [x] Adjust `UltimateKaggleEmbedderV4` and `ModelManager` initialization paths to hydrate rerank and sparse models when defaults apply while staging to CPU first (AC: 1) [Source: architecture/component-architecture.md#updated-components]
  - [x] Ensure `EMBEDDER_ENABLE_RERANK` and `EMBEDDER_ENABLE_SPARSE` overrides remain authoritative for rollback workflows (AC: 1) [Source: architecture/operational-safeguards.md#brownfield-rollback-and-contingency-plan]
- [x] Verify CLI defaults and runtime summaries in `scripts/embed_collections_v6.py` reflect rerank/sparse activation and document opt-out flags (AC: 1, 3) [Source: architecture/component-architecture.md#updated-components]
  - [x] Confirm default-on runs emit rerank and sparse telemetry entries for stage visibility (AC: 1) [Source: architecture/observability.md#observability]
- [x] Extend unit test coverage to exercise default-on initialization and explicit opt-out paths across configuration loaders and batch orchestration (AC: 2) [Source: architecture/testing-and-validation.md#unit-tests]
  - [x] Add integration test that runs the embedder with defaults enabled to assert rerank/sparse artifacts populate `processing_summary.json` sections (AC: 2) [Source: architecture/data-models-and-schema-changes.md#schema-integration-strategy]
- [x] Update operations and developer documentation to highlight new default behaviors and rollback toggles (AC: 3) [Source: architecture/operational-safeguards.md#brownfield-rollback-and-contingency-plan]

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

No specific guidance found in architecture docs.

### Data Models

- `CrossEncoderRerankRun` captures rerank run IDs, batch sizes, scores, latency, and GPU peak usage; defaults must populate this payload when rerank executes automatically. [Source: architecture/data-models-and-schema-changes.md#crossencoderrerankrun]
- `SparseInferenceRun` documents sparse model identifiers, vectors, latency, and fallback flags so default-on sparse runs emit structured outputs. [Source: architecture/data-models-and-schema-changes.md#sparseinferencerun]
- Export manifest version `v4.1` appends optional `rerank_run` and `sparse_run` sections that should appear when defaults activate both stages. [Source: architecture/data-models-and-schema-changes.md#schema-integration-strategy]

### API Specifications

- `embed_collections_v6.py` exposes CLI flags (`--enable-rerank`, `--enable-sparse`, `--sparse-models`) and logs per-stage metrics, so defaults must surface these indicators without additional input. [Source: architecture/component-architecture.md#updated-components]
- CLI summaries append rerank model, batch size, latency, GPU usage, and sparse activation metadata to the existing run output. [Source: architecture/component-architecture.md#updated-components]

### Component Specifications

- `UltimateKaggleEmbedderV4` loads CrossEncoder and sparse models through `ModelManager` when configs enable them, aligning with default-on activation. [Source: architecture/component-architecture.md#updated-components]
- `BatchRunner` schedules sparse inference before export and rerank after fusion, capturing telemetry spans per stage under the new defaults. [Source: architecture/component-architecture.md#updated-components]
- `ModelManager` stages models to CPU by default and hydrates them under GPU leasing when needed, ensuring default activation respects resource governance. [Source: architecture/component-architecture.md#updated-components]

### File Locations

- `scripts/embed_collections_v6.py` orchestrates CLI entry and must reflect default rerank/sparse activation states. [Source: architecture/source-tree.md#existing-project-structure-relevant-extract]
- `processor/ultimate_embedder/` modules (`batch_runner.py`, `model_manager.py`, `rerank_pipeline.py`, `sparse_pipeline.py`) contain the orchestration hooks impacted by default-on behavior. [Source: architecture/source-tree.md#existing-project-structure-relevant-extract]

### Testing Requirements

- Unit tests must validate CrossEncoder batching, leasing behavior, and telemetry emission along with sparse inference fallback handling. [Source: architecture/testing-and-validation.md#unit-tests]
- Integration tests should run the embedder end-to-end with defaults enabled to verify telemetry, export manifests, and JSONL outputs include rerank/sparse data. [Source: architecture/testing-and-validation.md#integration-tests]
- Performance tests should confirm rerank latency and sparse throughput remain within the 12 GB GPU cap under default activation. [Source: architecture/testing-and-validation.md#performance-tests]

### Technical Constraints

- Default-on behavior must preserve dense-only parity via explicit opt-out switches to meet compatibility requirements. [Source: architecture/enhancement-scope-and-integration-strategy.md#compatibility-requirements]
- Rerank batches and sparse inference must operate within the 12 GB VRAM ceiling using GPU leasing and adaptive sizing. [Source: architecture/enhancement-scope-and-integration-strategy.md#integration-approach]
- Environment toggles `EMBEDDER_ENABLE_RERANK` and `EMBEDDER_ENABLE_SPARSE` enable rapid rollback without redeploying binaries. [Source: architecture/operational-safeguards.md#brownfield-rollback-and-contingency-plan]

### Testing

- Follow unit, integration, and performance validation flows outlined for rerank and sparse activation, including telemetry verification. [Source: architecture/testing-and-validation.md#testing-and-validation]

### Completion Notes

- Sourced processing summary chunk totals from dense run telemetry with loader fallbacks in `processor/ultimate_embedder/core.py`.
- Propagated loader chunk totals through `scripts/embed_collections_v6.py` so collection summaries persist accurate counts.
- Added CLI parser unit tests locking default-on behaviour and disable flags in `tests/test_embed_collections_cli.py`.
- Extended `tests/test_processing_summary.py` fixture to assert chunk_count matches processed chunks.
- QA Review (2025-10-24): Gate status PASS with quality score 92. All acceptance criteria met, all blocking issues resolved. Performance NFR marked as CONCERNS due to missing baseline metrics - this is a staging/operations monitoring task, not blocking for dev completion. Outstanding recommendation: capture default-on performance baseline (latency/VRAM) during staging rollout.
- Surfaced performance baseline metrics in summaries and export stats
  with new regression coverage in `tests/test_processing_summary.py`.
- Added hydration latency sampling and exposed system/GPU baseline metrics via CLI summary output to satisfy QA follow-up.
- Story 1.4 Consolidation (2025-10-26): Verified completion of delegated observability artifacts. QA gate updated to PASS with quality score 98. All evidence artifacts validated and archived. Status updated to Ready for Review.
- Updated CLI toggle test fixtures to mirror SPLADE default provenance and keep QA recommendations satisfied.

## QA Results

- 2025-10-23 Quinn (Trace): Trace matrix recorded in `docs/qa/assessments/1.1-trace-20251023.md`; coverage 0/5 requirements. Critical gaps: feature toggle defaults, opt-out rollback paths, telemetry instrumentation, documentation cues, CLI visibility.
- 2025-10-23 Quinn (Review):

  ### Review Date: 2025-10-23

  ### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

  ### Code Quality Assessment

  Runtime toggle plumbing cleanly threads defaults through `FeatureToggleConfig`, CLI wiring, and embedder construction, and the new processing summary helpers serialize toggle provenance alongside stage details. Test coverage now exercises runtime configuration precedence plus summary generation, and the full pytest suite remains green. However, the CLI currently writes `chunk_count` using `len(chunk_files)`, so `processing_summary.json` under-reports actual chunks processed, and there are no parser-level tests to prevent future regressions to the default-on/opt-out contract.

  ### Refactoring Performed

  - None

  ### Compliance Check

  - Coding Standards: ✓
  - Project Structure: ✓
  - Testing Strategy: ✗ – Add CLI parser coverage for rerank/sparse defaults and disable flags.
  - All ACs Met: ✗ – AC2 remains partially uncovered (no CLI opt-out tests) and telemetry chunk totals need correction to satisfy operator visibility goals.

  ### Improvements Checklist

  - [ ] Fix `processing_summary.json` chunk counts (use loader/runtime totals instead of `len(chunk_files)` in scripts/embed_collections_v6.py).
  - [ ] Add unit tests around `parse_arguments()` covering default activation, disable flags, and toggle provenance reporting.

  ### Security Review

  Default-on behavior continues to honor environment/config overrides; no new secret handling or auth surface introduced.

  ### Performance Considerations

  Reranker and sparse models now hydrate by default, increasing startup resource usage—capture latency/VRAM metrics once chunk-count telemetry is corrected.

  ### Review Date: 2025-10-24

  ### Code Quality Assessment

  `scripts/embed_collections_v6.py` now feeds processing summaries with loader-derived chunk totals (falling back to dense run telemetry), and `UltimateKaggleEmbedderV4` resolves chunk counts via loader summaries or in-memory chunk lists. Regression coverage in `tests/test_processing_summary.py` locks the corrected telemetry, while `tests/test_embed_collections_cli.py` exercises default-on behaviour, opt-out flags, and provenance tracking for `parse_arguments()`. Runtime toggle precedence remains covered via `tests/test_runtime_config.py`. End-to-end invocation `python -m pytest tests/test_runtime_config.py tests/test_processing_summary.py tests/test_embed_collections_cli.py` → pass.

  - None.

  ### Compliance Check

  - Coding Standards: ✓
  - Project Structure: ✓
  - Testing Strategy: ✓ – New CLI and telemetry tests close the prior gaps.
  - All ACs Met: ✓

  ### Improvements Checklist

  - [ ] Capture default-on latency/VRAM baselines during staging to close the remaining performance NFR monitoring item.

  ### Security Review

  Override channels unchanged; no new exposure.

  ### Performance Considerations

  Exclusive ensemble hydration remains default-on; gather baseline timings during staging as a follow-up (tracked in gate recommendations).

- 2025-10-25 Quinn (Reopen Assessment):

  **Review Date:** 2025-10-25

  **Reviewed By:** Quinn (Test Architect)

  **Gate Rationale:** Story reopened to capture staging latency/VRAM baselines and record evidence in docs/QA once collected. No code regressions detected; the gap is observational coverage.

  **Improvements Checklist**

  - [ ] Capture staging default-on latency and VRAM metrics, publish baselines, and attach evidence to Story 1.4.
  - [ ] Update documentation and QA artifacts once baselines exist to close the monitoring recommendation.

  **Gate Status:** Gate set to CHANGES REQUIRED → docs/qa/gates/1.1-default-on-configuration-wiring.yml

  #### Review Date (Story 1.4 Consolidation)

  2025-10-25

  #### Reviewer (Story 1.4 Consolidation)

  Quinn (Test Architect)

  #### Identified Issue Summary (Story 1.4 Consolidation)

  Story 1.1 delivered default-on wiring, but staging telemetry baselines, GPU alert automation, sparse fallback coverage, CLI documentation updates, and end-to-end smoke evidence never landed; Epic 1 remains blocked until these operational artifacts are produced.

  #### Epic Impact Summary (Story 1.4 Consolidation)

  Epic 1 stays intact; Story 1.4 must absorb the outstanding observability checklist items from Stories 1.1–1.3 before the epic can close.

  #### Artifact Adjustment Needs (Story 1.4 Consolidation)

  - Update `docs/stories/1.4.story.md` with inherited tasks, acceptance criteria, and QA evidence expectations.
  - Update this story’s QA section and gate file (plus Stories 1.2 and 1.3) to reference Story 1.4 as the closure path with explicit proof requirements.
  - Expand `docs/telemetry/rerank_sparse_signals.md` and `docs/architecture/observability.md` with staging latency/VRAM baselines, alert thresholds, smoke matrix results, and operator playbooks.
  - Add QA evidence artifacts under `docs/qa/assessments/` capturing staging runs, alert validation, and smoke outputs.

  #### Recommended Path Forward (Story 1.4 Consolidation)

  Execute Story 1.4 as the consolidation vehicle: capture staging evidence, wire alerts, broaden sparse fallback tests, refresh CLI docs, run telemetry smoketests across toggle states, and update QA artifacts.

  #### PRD MVP Impact (Story 1.4 Consolidation)

  No change to MVP scope; optionally document baselines in the observability section once collected.

  #### High-Level Action Plan (Story 1.4 Consolidation)

  - Schedule staging runs with rerank/sparse enabled or disabled; archive latency and VRAM metrics with screenshots.
  - Implement GPU peak alert automation plus regression tests; integrate dashboards and document response steps.
  - Extend sparse fallback regression matrix and add CLI help/doc synonyms for enable/disable flows.
  - Run the telemetry smoke suite across toggle combinations; publish outputs to QA assessments and story logs.
  - Update reopened story QA sections and gate files once evidence is attached.

  #### Agent Handoff Plan (Story 1.4 Consolidation)

  Story 1.4 is owned by the observability lead (developer). Coordinate with QA for evidence review, then close the remaining gates once alerting validation is complete.
