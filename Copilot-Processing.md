Request Details:
- Archive the OpenSpec change `refactor-embedding-pipeline` via `/openspec archive`.

Action Plan:
1. Inspect OpenSpec change directory to confirm readiness for archiving.
2. Execute `/openspec archive refactor-embedding-pipeline` using the project CLI.
3. Verify command output and repository state for successful archival.

Task Tracking:
- [x] Review change folder contents and ensure no pending tasks block archival (depends on Action Plan 1).
- [x] Run the archive command via appropriate tooling (depends on Action Plan 2).
- [x] Check resulting status or logs to confirm archive completion (depends on Action Plan 3).

Execution Notes:
- Verified change directory structure (design, proposal, tasks) prior to archiving.
- `openspec archive refactor-embedding-pipeline` aborted with warnings about missing proposal sections and 10 incomplete tasks; no archival performed.

Summary:
- Archive command failed because proposal.md is missing required Why/What sections and tasks.md still has 10 incomplete items; change remains active.
