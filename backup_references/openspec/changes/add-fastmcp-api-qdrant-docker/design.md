## Context
The project needs a fully optimized, production-ready FastMCP server with comprehensive REST API integration that maximizes Qdrant performance through advanced connection pooling, multi-level caching, and intelligent query routing. Current implementations lack the optimization needed for high-throughput production deployments and miss critical endpoints for intelligent knowledge base operations.

## Goals / Non-Goals
- Goals: Create high-performance FastMCP server with 15+ REST endpoints, optimize Qdrant operations, provide intelligent query routing, achieve 500+ queries/sec, support structured learning and content analysis
- Non-Goals: Replace all existing MCP servers, add authentication, support non-Qdrant databases

## Decisions

### Architecture: FastMCP + FastAPI Dual Interface with Advanced Routing
**Chosen:** FastMCP server with comprehensive FastAPI REST endpoints including intelligent routing
**Rationale:** Provides both MCP protocol compliance and direct API access for maximum flexibility with smart query classification

### Performance Optimizations
**Chosen:** Multi-level caching (embeddings + queries + results), connection pooling, async operations, intelligent batching
**Rationale:** Critical for achieving target 500+ queries/sec performance with intelligent routing reducing irrelevant results by 70%

### Docker Strategy: Multi-stage Performance Build with Advanced Monitoring
**Chosen:** Python slim base with compiled extensions, optimized layers, and comprehensive health checks
**Rationale:** Minimal image size, maximum performance, security hardening, and production monitoring

### Embedding Strategy: CodeRankEmbed with Advanced LRU Cache and Auto-classification
**Chosen:** CodeRankEmbed with in-memory LRU cache plus query result caching and intelligent collection routing
**Rationale:** Leverages proven model performance with comprehensive caching and auto-classification for optimal knowledge retrieval

### API Design: Comprehensive REST Endpoints with MCP Tool Parity
**Chosen:** 15+ REST endpoints mirroring all MCP tools plus advanced features like learning, similarity, and analytics
**Rationale:** Complete API coverage for all Qdrant knowledge base operations with enterprise-grade features

## Risks / Trade-offs

### Complexity vs Performance
- **Risk:** Advanced optimizations and extensive API surface increase code complexity
- **Mitigation:** Comprehensive testing, monitoring, and modular design
- **Trade-off:** Accept complexity for 10x performance improvement and complete feature coverage

### Memory vs Speed
- **Risk:** Multi-level caching layers consume significant memory
- **Mitigation:** Configurable cache sizes, memory monitoring, cache eviction policies
- **Trade-off:** Accept memory overhead for sub-50ms response times and intelligent routing

### Coupling vs Flexibility
- **Risk:** Deep Qdrant integration and extensive feature set limits future changes
- **Mitigation:** Abstract interfaces, modular design, and comprehensive testing
- **Trade-off:** Accept coupling for performance optimization and complete feature coverage

## Performance Targets
- **Query Latency:** <50ms for cached embeddings, <200ms for new queries, <10ms for cached results
- **Throughput:** 500+ queries/second with intelligent routing reducing irrelevant results by 70%
- **Memory Usage:** <512MB per container instance with configurable cache sizes
- **Startup Time:** <30 seconds cold start, <5 seconds warm start
- **API Coverage:** 15+ REST endpoints with full MCP tool parity

## Migration Plan
1. Deploy enhanced server alongside existing implementations
2. A/B test performance improvements and new endpoint functionality
3. Gradually migrate traffic to new server with feature flags
4. Deprecate old implementations after 30-day validation period
5. Roll out advanced features (learning, similarity, analytics) incrementally

## Open Questions
- Should we implement request queuing for overload protection?
- What metrics should be exposed for monitoring?
- How to handle embedding model updates?
- Should we add rate limiting for different endpoint types?
- How to optimize cache invalidation strategies?
- Should we implement request deduplication for identical queries?
