## Context
The project needs a standardized MCP server for vector operations that can be deployed as a containerized service. Existing Qdrant MCP implementations are scattered across multiple files with inconsistent APIs. The new server should provide a clean, FastMCP-based interface that integrates seamlessly with the existing Docker architecture and leverages the project's existing Qdrant knowledge base.

## Goals / Non-Goals
- Goals: Create containerized MCP server, provide semantic search using CodeRankEmbed, support vector collection management
- Non-Goals: Replace existing MCP implementations, add authentication/authorization, support non-Qdrant vector databases

## Decisions

### Architecture Decision: FastMCP + FastAPI
**Chosen:** FastMCP server with HTTP transport via FastAPI
**Alternatives considered:**
- Native MCP server: Too complex for container deployment
- Direct FastAPI: Misses MCP protocol standardization
**Rationale:** FastMCP provides MCP protocol compliance with simple HTTP deployment

### Embedding Model
**Chosen:** nomic-ai/CodeRankEmbed (768D) - optimized for code and technical documentation
**Rationale:** Proven performance in existing project (310-516 chunks/sec), matches Qdrant knowledge base

### Tool Interface Design
**Chosen:** Separate tools for search, upload, and management operations
**Rationale:** Clear separation of concerns, easier testing and maintenance

### Docker Strategy
**Chosen:** Multi-stage build with Python slim base image
**Rationale:** Smaller image size, better security, faster deployments

## Risks / Trade-offs

### Performance vs Simplicity
- **Risk:** HTTP transport adds latency vs direct MCP connections
- **Mitigation:** Optimize FastAPI for low-latency responses
- **Trade-off:** Accept slightly higher latency for deployment simplicity

### Dependency Complexity
- **Risk:** Additional dependencies (FastMCP, HTTP server libraries, CodeRankEmbed)
- **Mitigation:** Pin versions, regular security updates
- **Trade-off:** Accept dependency complexity for protocol compliance and performance

## Migration Plan
1. Deploy new MCP server alongside existing implementations
2. Update client configurations to use new server
3. Deprecate old implementations after validation
4. Remove legacy code in future release

## Open Questions
- Should the server support both HTTP and stdio transports?
- What authentication mechanism should be used for MCP clients?
