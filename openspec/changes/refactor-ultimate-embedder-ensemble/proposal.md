## Why
The modular Ultimate Embedder package still carries vestiges of the monolithic buildâ€”parallel ensemble paths, dormant sparse pipelines, and partially implemented configuration flags. These leftovers complicate maintenance and hide the true single-model-at-a-time GPU leasing flow that production runs rely on. Aligning the code and specs with the exclusive ensemble design will simplify the control surface and prevent regressions.

## What Changes
- Refactor ensemble execution to rely solely on the exclusive GPU leasing path and delete the parallel/sequential toggle code.
- Trim `EnsembleConfig` to the active fields, drop dormant sparse helpers, and remove dead telemetry/progress utilities.
- Establish `KAGGLE_OPTIMIZED_MODELS` as the authoritative dense model registry across the package and tests.
- Update specs and tests to exercise the exclusive-only ensemble flow and assert the retired APIs stay removed.
- **BREAKING** Remove the sparse runtime exports and deprecated CLI helpers where the API surface allowed them to linger.

## Impact
- Affected specs: embedding-pipeline
- Affected code: processor/ultimate_embedder/*, scripts/embed_collections_v5.py, tests covering ensemble runs
