# Task 2.4 â€“ Reranker Feature Implementation Request

Deliver a fully functional CrossEncoder rerank stage for the modular ultimate embedder. The work should audit existing reranker hooks, revive or adapt helper utilities for device assignment and lifecycle management, and update the CLI entry path so the supported execution flow is unambiguous. Ensure the integration aligns with `RerankPipeline`, preserves telemetry coverage, and fits cleanly alongside the exclusive ensemble pass.
